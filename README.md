## Hosting Miza!
#### Prerequisites:
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Discord Bot Token](https://discord.com/developers/) (_Choose your Desired Bot then go to **Bot** and under Token click **Copy**_)

### Installing Miza
* Launch Git Bash.
* Navigate to your desired directory, by typing this command in Git Bash:
```
cd [Desired Directory]
Example: cd /C/Users/Miza/Documents/Projects/
```
* Clone this Repository, by typing this command in Git Bash:
```
git clone https://github.com/thomas-xin/Miza.git
```
* Run `main.bat` the bot will automatically create an `auth.json` file.
* Edit `auth.json` file (prefix, discord_token, etc)
* Run `main.bat` again.  _(Miza should now start succesfully, and be ready for use.  if not read the [next section](#common-issues))_ 

<a id="common-issues"></a>
### Common Issues & FAQ:

#### Dependencies:

* Miza should automatically the required dependencies right after running her for the first time, notably the Python modules and FFmpeg.
##### Additional Notes:
_As of 08/12/2021, FFmpeg will be automatically installed after first run, Miza is also going to look through the servers it is in to seek out open candidates for placing some emojis that Miza will also require for certain UI features, so make sure you have a good space set up too. Finally, all API Keys that Miza will require as located in *auth.json* you will have to obtain yourself._ <br>

#### Voice commands not working:
* Make sure you have [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) and [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed onto your computer and in your PATH (it doesn't need to be in the same directory as Miza). I uh... Actually have my ffmpeg pathed by pathing to the misc folder found in [Miza Player](https://github.com/thomas-xin/Miza-Player) (an awesome program you should definitely try out!) ðŸ™ƒ

![ffmpeg](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688253918890688521/777473182294474753/image0.png)

_Note: voice commands run in a subprocess concurrently to the main program. If you are still facing issues, check the [support](#support-section) section._

#### MemoryError():

* This used to be an issue caused by Miza trying to cache too much at one time. This caching system has been watered down significantly since the time this README was made, so this wont be as likely of an issue anymore. But in case it is still a problem, here's how to fix it. Head on over to the top of *bot.py*, and look for the following function:

```python
def __init__(self, cache_size=4194304, timeout=24):
        self.start_time = utc()
        super().__init__(max_messages=256, heartbeat_timeout=60, guild_ready_timeout=5, intents=self.intents)
        self.cache_size = cache_size
        self.cache = fcdict({c: {} for c in self.caches})

        # Code continues...
```

Just reduce the number in `cache_size=4194304` and you should be good to go.

_Note: memory cache gets cleared upon reset, and Miza has a seperate disk cache that doesn't upon reset, but all files in the caches get automtically cleared after 2 weeks._

####  IP Address exposure:

Miza used to host a few Minecraft Servers which is why this feature used to be a doxx moment for me. That is no longer a risk, but Miza will still obtain your IP Address to store it internally for features such as the webserver.

#### Where does Miza log?

Miza logs up to three places:
* `log.txt` (which the file gets refreshed upon restart)<sup><a href="#logtxt-img">1</a></sup>
* The Console from which Miza is running.<sup><a href="#consolelog-img">2</a></sup>
* Log within Discord itself (which isn't hardcoded, you can enable it as displayed below) <sup><a href="#discordlog-img">3</a></sup>

_Note: execute the command `[prefix]exec -e log` to enable discord logging._

#### Why wont Miza work on Linux?

* Linux doesn't like her subprocesses, this has been an issue since the beginning. If you wish to host Miza, it is best you do so from a Windows OS, as Miza's infrastructure is designed on and for Windows.

## Folder Structure

#### Project Directory:
Has all your generic license, requirements, etc... (Though requirements is necessary for the *install_update* funtionality which, automatically checks for and installs any missing modules.) But most significantly, the main files responsible for running the bots code. Throughout the code, you will frequently see `from common import *`, which is because *common.py* contains all the main necessary functions and imports to be used throughout. *main.py* is the main process, while everything else runs as a subprocess, so if you make any changes to main.py, it'll require a manual restart. Most of the bots optimization and data collection funtionaility can be found in these files, (such as running the bot of course, starting the heartbeat.tmp and other log related code, caching, assigning variables of the Github Directory link, default bot prefix, etc...) As for where things are located...

#### Commands:

* You may think its unnecessary to explain all this, but before I learnt my way around, I got so lost in all of Miza's files, so hopefully this is helpful. The commands folder speaks for itself, all of the bots command categories can be found in here, and they are located in the same way they are categorized under ~help.

#### Misc:

* Misc has all the different files that the bot needs to pull from, such as the avatar (which gets automatically uploaded to the Discord Developers Portal the first time the code is run), the rainbow bar emojis (which get automatically uploaded to a server Miza is in if it cannot find the emojis already), the code necessary for converting org files, computing math equations, finding timezones and etc. You can change the bots avatar and emojis if you want to; *but if you want the code to use them the same way, the filename must be kept the same.*
